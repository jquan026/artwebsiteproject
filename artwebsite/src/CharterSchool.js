            We are so glad that you have chosen to use our services. We have
            been working with charter schools since we opened our first studio
            in 2001. Because the charter schools do things a little differently,
            we have taken the time to help explain the process to make it easier
            for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>The first class is always free for new students ages 5-17!</p>
          <p>
            Whether you are a charter school or not, we recommend that all our
            students try out our program to make sure it is a good fit before
            they sign up for the classes. Please make sure you get that first
            free class set up and then we can go from there.
